But the strict rule is: Flashing Red = STOP. Let's assume the question refers to the 'off-road' loading zone exception or lack of lights. Actually, NY Law says if the bus is off the roadway at a school, you can pass. But let's stick to the flashing light rule which is the testable one. Rephrasing: If a school bus is stopped on the highway with red lights flashing, can you pass? NO. Correct index implies 10mph? No. Let's look at answer C. Correct.",
